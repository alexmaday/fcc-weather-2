# fcc-weather-2

I left FCC for a while and when I came back, I decided to go back over the work I'd previously done. I'd forgotten a lot, so this was a good choice.

This weather project had some broken stuff in it, so working it out was a good challenge. This code is from codepen (which is not CORS friendly!)
